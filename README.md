Collaborative App: drawing together

Meteor allows us to make creative, collaborative apps that work in real-time. Both the Client and the Server can insert information into a Mongo collection. Ordinary web users can do this interactively, without having to program the database manually. In this session we will look at this approach through the lens of collaborative drawing. You will learn how to create a canvas using d3.js, change attributes of the canvas, create client code for inserting data into the database and how to render database entries as a drawing.
